                    My interest in technology has been a part of me for my entire life. The almost endless reach
                    technology
                    always seems to astonish me an lead me to figure out it works. This has led me on the adventure of
                    learning
                    to create and build things of my own. Code is the absolute closest thing we have to real magic.
                    They're so
                    much that has been done, is currently being used, and yet to even be understood. Knowing all that,
                    it
                    creates a feeling of exploration and freedom of creativity.

                    I first discovered what code was shortly after high school in my first full time job. I was tasked
                    with
                    helping setup and trial runs on new machines for the company. I worked closely with an electrical
                    engineer
                    through most of the process. After the machines were brought in and placed in their location on the
                    production floor, he began work on some of the wiring and power cables that connected it all
                    together. It
                    took several days and I remember the day exactly that he was finally ready to boot up the main
                    computer. A
                    screen with what seemed like gibberish or writings from the matrix covered the screen. He began
                    typing what
                    he called commands and algorithms. He explained to me what that meant and instantly I was hooked.
                    The idea
                    that I could type in "code" to tell the computer exactly what to do has stuck with me ever since
                    that day
                    and will for the rest of my life.
